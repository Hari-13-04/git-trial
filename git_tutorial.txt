# Git & GitHub Complete Tutorial

## 1. Introduction to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.

**Example:**
If you are writing a book and want to save each chapter separately, Git helps you save each version, revert to previous versions, and merge changes from different contributors.

---

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a **cloud-based hosting service** for Git repositories. It provides a web-based interface, collaboration tools, and features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management.

**Example:**
GitHub is like Google Drive for code—you can store your Git projects online, share them with others, and collaborate remotely.

---

### Difference Between Git and GitHub
| Git | GitHub |
|------|---------|
| Version control tool | Hosting service for Git repositories |
| Installed locally | Cloud-based platform |
| Manages version history | Adds collaboration features (PRs, issues, CI/CD) |
| Command-line interface | Web-based GUI + CLI support |
| Free and open-source | Free for public repos, paid for private |

## 2. Key Concepts

### Repository
A repository (or repo) is a **storage location** where your project files and their version history are stored. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub).

**Example:**
A repo is like a project folder that Git tracks—every change you make is recorded.

---

### Working Directory, Staging Area, Local Repository, and Commit
1. **Working Directory** – Where you make changes to files.
2. **Staging Area** – Where you prepare changes before committing.
3. **Local Repository** – Where committed changes are stored permanently.
4. **Commit** – A snapshot of changes saved to the repository with a message.

**Analogy:**
Think of it like packing for a trip:
- Working Directory = Your room with clothes scattered.
- Staging Area = Your suitcase where you choose what to pack.
- Commit = Zipping the suitcase with a label ("Beach trip").
- Local Repository = Your closet where the packed suitcase is stored.

## 3. Installation & Setup

### Install Git
Download Git from the official website:
https://git-scm.com/

After installation, verify:
```bash
git --version
Git Bash
Git Bash is a terminal emulator for Windows that provides a Linux-like command-line interface for using Git.

4. Basic Commands & Workflow
Initialize a Local Repository
bash
git init
This turns your current folder into a Git-tracked repository.

Clone a Remote Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
This downloads a remote repository to your local machine.

Check Status
bash
git status
Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

Staging Changes
bash
git add file.txt          # Stage a specific file
git add .                 # Stage all changes in current directory
git add --all             # Stage all changes (including deletions)
git add *.js              # Stage all JavaScript files
To unstage:

bash
git reset file.txt
Committing Changes
bash
git commit -m "Added login feature"
If you see an error about user identity, set your global config:

bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
To undo the last commit:

bash
git reset HEAD~
5. File & Folder Management
Remove Files from Git (Without Deleting Locally)
bash
git rm --cached file.txt
Remove Files from Git and Locally
bash
git rm file.txt
Force Remove
bash
git rm -f file.txt
Remove Folder
bash
git rm -r folder_name
6. Viewing History
View Commit Log
bash
git log
git log --oneline
Compare Commits
bash
git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2
Switch to a Previous Commit
bash
git checkout commit_id
7. Branching & Merging
What is Branching?
Branching allows you to create a separate line of development. Useful for features, experiments, or bug fixes without affecting the main code.

Create and Switch Branches
bash
git branch feature-login      # Create branch
git checkout feature-login    # Switch to branch
Merge Branches
bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login -m "Merge login feature"
8. Remote Operations
Push to Remote
bash
git push origin main
Pull from Remote
bash
git pull origin main
(Pull = Fetch + Merge)

Fetch from Remote
bash
git fetch
(Fetches changes but does not merge)

9. Stash
What is Stash?
Stash temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can switch branches without committing.

bash
git stash                    # Save changes
git stash pop               # Apply and remove stash
git stash apply             # Apply but keep in stash list
git stash list              # View stashes
git stash drop              # Delete stash
10. Revert vs Reset
Revert
Creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit.

bash
git revert commit_id
Reset
Moves the branch pointer backward, erasing commits (use with caution).

bash
git reset --hard commit_id
Difference:

Revert is safe for shared repos—it keeps history intact.

Reset rewrites history and is risky for shared branches.

11. Rebase
Rebase rewrites commit history by moving commits to a new base. Useful for clean linear history.

bash
git rebase main
Use carefully—it rewrites commit IDs.

12. Pull Request
A Pull Request (PR) is a GitHub feature that lets you propose changes and request a review before merging into the main branch. It's not a Git command but a collaboration workflow.

Example:
You create a feature branch → push to GitHub → open a PR → team reviews → merge to main.

13. Restore Changes
Restore Files to Last Commit
bash
git restore file.txt
Unstage Files
bash
git restore --staged file.txt
14. Summary of Common Workflow
git init or git clone

Make changes in working directory

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git push origin main

For collaboration: git pull, branch, merge, or rebase

15. Practical Examples
Example 1: Starting a New Project
bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Example 2: Working with Branches
bash
# Create and work on a feature
git checkout -b new-feature
# Make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
Example 3: Fixing Mistakes
bash
# Accidentally committed wrong file
git reset HEAD~1
# Made changes to wrong file
git restore file.txt
# Need to switch branches but not ready to commit
git stash
git checkout other-branch
git stash pop
16. Best Practices
Commit Often: Small, frequent commits are easier to manage

Write Clear Messages: Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

Use Branches: Keep main branch stable

Pull Before Push: Avoid merge conflicts

Review Before Merging: Use pull requests for team projects

17. Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue: "Please tell me who you are"
Solution:

bash
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Issue: Merge conflicts
Solution:

Open conflicting files

Resolve conflicts (look for <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)

Stage resolved files: git add .

Commit: git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

Issue: Accidentally committed to wrong branch
Solution:

bash
git reset HEAD~1
git stash
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop
